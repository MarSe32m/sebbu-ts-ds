# sebbu-ts-ds

This package contains "thread safe" data structures such as queues and stacks etc.
This isn't intended to be a solution for everyones threading problems and mainly for my own usage since I do this as a hobby.
That said you can use this package as you like, copy it, modify it etc. at your own risk.
